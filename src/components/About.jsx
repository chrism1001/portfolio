            <p1 className="text-white">I am committed to life long learning. I am a full stack software engineer, and I recently graduated from New Jersey Institute of Technolgy.
                I have a deep passion for programming and data structures and algorithms. When I'm not being a Leetcode monkey, I enjoy playing chess and running. 
                Feel free to check out some of my projects below.
